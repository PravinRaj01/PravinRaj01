# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umenzi/umenzi/main/wave.gif" width="30px"> Hi there

My name is Javier Paez, a graduate student at Imperial College 🇬🇧 pursuing a M.Sc. in Computer Science, specialized in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from TU Delft 🇳🇱, where I joined the challenging Next Generation Robotics Honours Program, a two-year research program where ten carefully selected B.Sc. students work on research projects at the TU Delft Robotics Institute.

💻 My interests lie within the field of AI & Machine Learning

🎶 Outside my academic and professional pursuits, I am passionate about music, having played the violin with multiple orchestras worldwide

🎞️ I am also interested in video games and cinematography

If you like what I do, maybe consider buying me a coffee/tea 👉👈
